# Generating Random Numbers

Functions for probability distributions in R

- *rnorm*: generate random normal variates with a given mean and standard
deviation.
- *dnorm*: evaluate the normal probability denisty (with a given mean/SD) at a
point (or vector of points)
- *pnorm*: evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal
distribution.
- *rpois*: generate a random Poisson variates with a given rate.
